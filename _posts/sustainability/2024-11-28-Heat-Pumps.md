## How does a heat pump work?
1. **Refrigerant**
    - Heat pumps operate using a special fluid called the refrigerant. Whatâ€™s unique about refrigerants is that it boils at very low temperatures. This characteristic allows the capture of energy even from low temperatures. The refrigerant begins as a low pressure, low temperature liquid, which is directed to the evaporator.
2. **Evaporator**
    - The evaporator, a heat exchanger, interacting with outside air for air source heat pumps, causes the refrigerant to boil as ambient air passes over it, transforming the refrigerant into a low temperature cold vapour. As the liquid boils it gains energy from the outside air, causing it to evaporate into a gas. This vapour is then carried to the compressor. 
3. **Compressor**
    - The compressor uses electricity to increase the pressure of the refrigerant which causes the temperature to rise. The high pressure high temperature vapour is then taken to the condenser.
4. **Condenser**
    - The condenser is a heat exchanger, which releases energy to the water in the storage tank. During this process, the refrigerant undergoes condensation, releasing energy and transforming into a liquid.
    - The refrigerant then passes out the storage tank and to the expansion vessel.
5. **Expansion vessel**
    - The expansion vessel drops the pressure, leading to a drop in temperature. The now low pressure, low temperature liquid repeats the cycle by returning to the evaporator.
